# DocSumAI: AI-Powered Document Summarizer ðŸ“š

DocSumAI is an advanced AI-powered tool designed to summarize documents efficiently and accurately. It supports multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT) and URLs, offering three distinct summarization methods: **LLM-based**, **NLP pipeline-based**, and **extractive summarization**. The tool also provides detailed evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the generated summaries.

## Features âœ¨

- **Multi-format Support**: Summarize documents in PDF, DOCX, TXT formats, or directly from URLs.
- **Three Summarization Methods**:
  - **LLM Summarization**: Leverages advanced language models like `llama3-70b-8192` for high-quality summaries.
  - **NLP Pipeline Summarization**: Uses the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model for abstractive summarization.
  - **Extractive Text Summarization**: Extracts key sentences using spaCy's NLP capabilities.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Provides BLEU, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and METEOR scores to evaluate summary quality.
- **Visualization**: Generates bar charts to represent evaluation metrics visually.
- **Scalability**: Built with modularity and scalability in mind, making it easy to extend or integrate into larger systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Install dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/v26199/DocSumAI-AI-Powered-Document-Summarizer.git
   cd DocSumAI-AI-Powered-Document-Summarizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:
     ```
     HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     ```
   - **Important**: Do not commit this `.env` file to your repository. Add it to `.gitignore`.

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Upload or Enter URL**:
   - Choose to upload a file (PDF, DOCX, TXT) or enter a URL to summarize web content.
   - Select the desired summarization method and configure settings like summary length or number of extractive sentences.

2. **View Results**:
   - The app generates a summary and displays evaluation metrics to help you understand the quality of the output.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

The app evaluates summaries using the following metrics:
- **BLEU**: Measures n-gram overlap between the summary and the original text.
- **ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L**: Assess unigram recall, bigram recall, and longest common subsequence, respectively.
- **METEOR**: Considers synonymy and alignment between the generated and reference texts.

A bar chart is generated to visually represent these metrics, helping users quickly interpret the quality of the generated summary.
